    <h3>About Restaurant Hub</h3>
    <p>The Restaurant Hub Android Application promotes restaurant sales by facilitating the location, comparison and customer order taking from nearby restaurants. During account sign up, the user is required to enter a credit card information. That way, the customer will be able to place orders with the click of a button and the restaurant will have a payment guarantee in case a customer does not show up to pick up an order. The application would tap into the mobile device’s GPS to determine the user’s exact location and list all nearby restaurants. An artificial intelligence algorithm would then make restaurant and menu items’ recommendations based on the user’s location, order history and feedback (ratings). Using Google Maps API, the application would provide estimated distance and the time it would take for the customer to reach any of the restaurants listed. The application would notify the restaurant to start food preparation as soon as a new order arrives. It would also provide the customer’s estimated time of arrival allowing the restaurant to prioritize order preparation. When the order is ready for pickup, the application would then notify the customer via text message (if the customer selects that option in the app’s settings) and through in-app notifications (default).</p>
